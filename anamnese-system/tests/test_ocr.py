# More comprehensive tests would require sample images with known text
# and potentially mocking pytesseract.image_to_string if Tesseract is not
# available or for more controlled testing.
# For now, these are placeholder tests.

# Example of a test that might require Tesseract and a sample image:
# def test_extract_known_text():
#     # This test would require a sample image file and Tesseract setup
#     # For simplicity, we'll simulate an image with text.
#     # In a real scenario, you'd load an image that contains known text.
#     # Create an image with some white text on a black background.
#     # This is a very simplified representation.
#     # Real OCR testing is more complex.
#     image = np.zeros((100, 300), dtype=np.uint8) # Black background
#     # Add some "text" (white pixels) - this won't actually be OCR'd correctly
#     # by Tesseract without a proper image of text.
#     # cv2.putText(image, "HELLO", (20, 50), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (255,255,255), 2)
#
#     # For a real test, you might have an image file:
#     # from app.input_handler import load_form_as_image
#     # from app.preprocessor import preprocess_image
#     # image_raw = load_form_as_image("path/to/sample_ocr_image.png")
#     # processed_image = preprocess_image(image_raw) # Assuming preprocess returns grayscale/binary
#
#     # coords_for_hello = {'x': 10, 'y': 10, 'width': 280, 'height': 80}
#     # expected_text = "HELLO"
#     # actual_text = extract_text(image, coords_for_hello)
#     # assert expected_text in actual_text # Use 'in' for flexibility
#     pass # Placeholder
